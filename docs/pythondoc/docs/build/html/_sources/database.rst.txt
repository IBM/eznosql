============
``database``
============

An EzNoSQL database contains a primary index along with an associated primary key.
Primary key names are restricted to 255 bytes, and must be contained in each document
and paired with a unique key-value.

If a key name is omitted, EzNoSQL will use a reserved key name and pre-append an
additional element at the beginning of the document consisting of ``"znsq_id"``
and an internally-generated (unique) 122 byte key-value. The autogenerated key-value
will be returned to the application following the write request, and can be used to
retrieve the associated document. Below is an example of a document containing the
pre-appended autogenerated key-value.

.. code:: json

    {
      "znsq_id": "F3F9F3F1C1F0F140404040404040404040404040F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F7F2F3C...",
      "Address": {
        "Street": "1 Main Street",
        "City": "New York",
        "State": "NY"
      },
      "Accounts": ["Checking", "Savings"]
    }
